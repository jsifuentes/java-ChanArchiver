# java-ChanArchiver

An incomplete system I created to archive 4chan threads.

I would highly recommend not using this for any purposes. It is not a complete, working piece of software, and it's not documented.

This software was developed back in November of 2014.

Any issues opened will most likely remain unanswered by me, as I have no interest in continuing this project. Sorry.

## Notes

- This is one of my first Java projects I created. The code may not be up to the best standards. In other words, excuse the mess.
- The original purpose of this project was for 4archive.org, a website I originally founded but no longer own.
